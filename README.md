# MIDI firmware for CH32V003-based stylophone

This is the code for using the [CH32V003 stylophone](https://github.com/Frogieder/CH32V003-stylophone) as a MIDI device.
It uses cnlohr's [rv003usb](https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb) to emulate the USB stack in software.
For more information about flashing and building the code, check out the [main repo](https://github.com/Frogieder/CH32V003-stylophone) of the project.
